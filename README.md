## Hi there, I'm Christian ðŸ‘‹

### About me! ðŸ¤“
A full-stack developer with a year of experience, building applications primarily out of curiosity and
personal interest. Someone who gets the job done, not to the extreme, but just enough, although being
an overthinker can sometimes be a double-edged sword.
